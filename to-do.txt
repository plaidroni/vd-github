-tobias work
1. create a AddDPPos command to save the location and angle into an sql database, have the vector dealer randomly take from that sql table and spawn at one of the locations, call the table by the map name, so if you switch maps, it will have a fresh table.
2. find a model for the vector dealer to use, preferably in source gmod, give it effects and shit to mask that its a normal gmod model (can be done in code)
3. either shroud his face in darkness or give him glowing eyes :)
4. research
