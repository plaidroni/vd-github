# Vector Dealer
This is a Garry's Mod extention which implements a new shop npc named the Vector Dealer. The Vector Dealer can be fully modulated by the administrator of the server through a plethora of the commands. This mod also introduces a new notification system that plays into a cat and mouse game for currency exclusively used by the Vector Dealer.

SO THE PLAN IS TWEAK THE MODEL AND MAKE IT LIKE ALIEN X WITH A HOODIE ON IT AND YOU GET SUCKED INTO A VOID USING STENCILS RIGHT AND THATS JUST ON YOUR SCREEN AND AFTER THE FADE OUT TIMER WHAT WE DO IS WE SPAWN A 1 WAY BOX IN FRONT OF THEIR SCREEN (OR SOMETHING) WHERE BASICALLY IT IS AS IF THEY ARE PURCHASING IN THE VOID SO
