# Vector Dealer
This is a Garry's Mod extention which implements a new shop npc named the Vector Dealer. The Vector Dealer can be fully modulated by the administrator of the server through a plethora of the commands. This mod also introduces a new notification system that plays into a cat and mouse game for currency exclusively used by the Vector Dealer.
